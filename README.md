# Actionfile

This is a fast and idiot proof command runner. Easy and freindly config language.

Example. Create a `.actions` file

```txt
hello = echo hello_world
```

For now you can now have space between the command name. This will be fixed later on.

## Install

Install the easy way (with the latest version of go installed on your system or above 1.23.4)

```
go install github.com/lassejlv/action@latest
```

Then run `action --help` and to upgrade in the feature. Use `action --upgrade` ðŸ˜€

#### The other way

Download a binary for your OS from the [releases](github.com/lassejlv/action/releases) page.
