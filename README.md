# Actionfile

This is a fast and idiot proof task runner. It works just like npm scripts but is much faster. It's written in go and is my first real like project so dont judge the code quality.

## How to get started?

Download an binary from the latest release (works cross platform ofc)

Then run `action --init` in the dir you wanna setup commands. And boom it creates a `.actions` file for you with examples.

- A better guide will come very soon!
